## :dart: About ##

MetaTube downloads video from YouTube and can add metadata from a specified metadata provider on the downloaded file.

## :sparkles: Features ##

It's finished (for now) and these features are currently supported:

:heavy_check_mark: Fetch information from a YouTube video based on an URL <br />
:heavy_check_mark: Query and fetch results from the Musicbrainz API, the Spotify Web API, and the Deezer API <br />
:heavy_check_mark: Set up templates and options for the YouTube download <br />
:heavy_check_mark: Download YouTube videos based on a selected template <br />
:heavy_check_mark: Exclude fragments (such as intros, outros, etc.) from the download <br />
:heavy_check_mark: Metadata from either the user or the chosen metadata provider can be merged with MP3, Opus, FLAC, WAV, OGG, M4A & MP4 files <br />
:heavy_check_mark: Hardware encoding using NVENC, Intel Quick Sync <br />
:heavy_check_mark: Hardware encoding is supported, but not yet tested for Video Toolbox, Video Acceleration API (VAAPI), AMD AMF & OpenMax OMX <br />
:heavy_check_mark: Manually set height and width, if a video type has been selected <br />
:heavy_check_mark: Store the information about downloaded releases in the database, to edit the downloaded metadata or the file itself later after the download <br />
:heavy_check_mark: Dark mode is available <br />
:heavy_check_mark: Docker is [supported](#whale-using-docker)

I'm currently not planning on adding any new features; I'll only fix any bugs, but if you have a nice feature, feel free to create an issue, and I'll decide whether I'll actually do it.

Before starting :checkered_flag:, you need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Python 3.8 or higher](https://python.org/downloads) installed.

## :checkered_flag: Starting ##

### :whale: Using Docker ###

CLI docker:

```docker
docker run \
  -d \
  --name metatube \
  --restart always \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  -e PORT=5000 \
  -e HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -v /downloads:/downloads:rw \
  -v /metatube:/database:rw \
  jvt038/metatube:latest
```

Docker-compose:

```
version: '3.3'
services:
    metatube:
        container_name: metatube
        restart: always
        image: jvt038/metatube:latest
        ports:
            - '5000:5000'
        environment:
            - PORT=5000
            - HOST=0.0.0.0
        volumes:
            - '/downloads:/downloads:rw'
            - '/metatube:/database:rw'        
```

You need to set the variable `DATABASE_URL` to a custom mount point (in these examples `/database`), because otherwise your database file will reset everytime the Docker container updates.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Manually build and start server ###

```bash
# Clone this project
$ git clone https://github.com/JVT038/metatube

# Access
$ cd metatube

# Skip these steps if you don't want to use a virtual environment
# Install virtualenv
$ pip install virtualenv
# Create virtual environment in current directory
$ virtualenv .
# Activate environment
# Windows:
$ cd Scripts
$ activate
# Linux:
$ source bin/activate
 
# Navigate to the root directory
$ cd ../

# Install dependencies
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# If you're using Windows, you need to install python-magic-bin
$ pip install python-magic-bin
# If you're using Debian / Ubuntu, you'll need to install libmagic1
$ sudo apt-get install libmagic1
# If you're using iOS, you'll need to install libmagic
$ brew install libmagic

# Run the file
$ python metatube.py

# The server will initialize in the <http://localhost:5000>
```

You can set the following environment variables:
Name | Description | Default value
---|---|---
PORT|Set the port on which the MetaTube server will be available|5000
HOST|Set the address on which the MetaTube server will run | 127.0.0.1
DEBUG|Whether to enable debug mode or not | False
DATABASE_URL | The URL to your Database. Currently only SQLite3 is supported. | sqlite:///app.db
FFMPEG | An absolute path to the folder containing ffmpeg. | Empty
DOWNLOADS | An absolute path to the default download folder | /absolute/path/to/MetaTube/downloads; absolute path will be calculated automatically
LOG | Whether to keep logs or not | False
SOCKET_LOG | Whether to log in- and outcoming websocket connections; warning: your console can be spammed with connections | False
LOG_LEVEL | Numeric value from which MetaTube will keep logs. Info [here](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#logging-levels) | 10
URL_SUBPATH | Set the URL subpath, if you want to run MetaTube on a subpath. Example: `/metatube` will run the server on `host:port/metatube` | /

```bash
# On Windows 10, you can set an environment variable like this: 
$ set ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE = Value

# On Linux and MacOS, you can set an environment variable like this:
$ export ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE = Value
```

Additionally you can create a file called `.flaskenv` and set the environment variables in there.
An example is provided in [example.flaskenv](example.flaskenv). You can use that template and rename the file to `.flaskenv`.

## Fix the artist values

So I recently discovered I made a mistake in the process of adding artists to files. <br/>
Some songs have tags multiple artists, and I noticed these tags were misinterpreted by my audio player. <br/>
Basically, the `TPE1` tag contained was like this: `['artist 1; artist 2']`, while it should've been `['artist 1', 'artist 2']`. <br/>
Thanks to [#310](https://github.com/quodlibet/mutagen/issues/310) I discovered this, corrected it in `metadata.py` and wrote a small script in [fixartists.py](fixartists.py) to fix the existing audio files that had the tags in the wrong way. <br/>
Put all the wrong audio files in one directory, run the file and enter the path to the directory containing the incorrect tags, and it should be fixed. <br/>
My apologies for this (annoying) bug.

## Disclaimer

I made this project to educate myself about Python, and to learn how metadata works in combination with files.
Additionally, I want to emphasize I do NOT encourage any pirating, or any other illegal activities.
This project's purpose isn't to illegally download content from YouTube; its purpose is to educate and enlighten myself (and others viewing the source code) about Python, how Python interacts with metadata in files, and  metadata works, and how yt-dlp works.
I am not responsible if the user downloads illegal content, or faces any (legal) consequences.
